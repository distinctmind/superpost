I often browse Pinterest as a way to get inspired to create instagram posts. So I find the perfect picture, but then, in order to create an instagram post from that picture, I have to download the picture, go to instagram, upload the picture, and then I can share my post. I find, that the process of downloading the image and going through the web instagram portal is not effecient. It's frustrating. So I set out to create an app to solve my pains. 

And this app is the solution to that.

For now, it works only for my specific business instagram account, but it allows me to simply input an image url, a caption, and when I click post, it automatically creates the instagram post on my behalf. I don't have to download the picture, I don't have to go through the instagram site.
Just, URL, CAPTION, AND POST!

Simple.

#TODO.
Make it so that upon refresh, my token stays alive, so I don't have to reconnect each time.. 
Allow multiple carousel post?
How can I make it so everyone can use this app, given they have a business instagram account?
